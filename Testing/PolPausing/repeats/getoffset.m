function out = getoffset(inx)
%Finds offset, alignment for polymerase repeats

%Take in data

%kdf it

%PWD it, find peak / find pspec peak

%This gives the length of a repeat == scale factor , cf actual length

%We now know the nucleotide positions a priori, so we know offset + nm/bp
% Fit [one-way] HMM to the known positions
