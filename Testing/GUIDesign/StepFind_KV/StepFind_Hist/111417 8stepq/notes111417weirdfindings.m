Stepfinding: 110817N109 (7-12pN) acting on the whole trace (not feedback-cycled), using Iter
Get crisp bimodal dist. at 8 and 10: Is the 8 from a 10-step that missed, and had to stop at 8 (a different subunit grabbed on?)
 Fits 4:5 ratio much better than 3:4 ratio
Dwell times after seem roughly equal (though N=1)

>Try more low force, high force traces
