What do we actually need to write?
Same precision: Store normalized voltages: 6 sensors (83 1/3 kHz)
-4 Normalized QPD outs
-MX, MY
Almost the same: skip Y's: 3 sensors (166 2/3 kHz)
-2 Normalized QPD outs
-MX
Extension/Force are hyp'd - if x >> y, then hyp(x,y) ~ x
Might introduce more noise than we save by increasing Fs, though
