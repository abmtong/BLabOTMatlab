This is the Matlab code written by me to be used for 
processing and analysis of optical tweezers data.

Version is R2016a with all/most toolboxes, issues may arise from different
 Matlab versions and toolbox installs. Hopefully, those errors should be
 easy to debug should you need to use a different Matlab version

Highlights include processing data from raw optical tweezers instrument output to usable distances,
 and their analysis for stepfinding, velocity profiling, and pause detection.

Most of the code will be found in ./DataGUIs/ [for analysis or viewing] or ./RawDataProcessing/ [for processing]

This contains a whole lot of code, most of which is a work-in-progress
 with less-than-stellar organization and documentation.
Feel free to contact me (info above) if you wish to use it and have any questions.
