Readme for submission to PNAS for manuscript:
    Monitoring the compaction of single DNA molecules in Xenopus egg extract in real time

Most of the code is found in .\Misc\MinaCondensation\, further names are relative to this path

The code for converting a (force, extension) trace to contour is in .\MiniProcessing\, this code also handles chopping the input trace into cycles of compaction and decompaction.

The code for plotting the compaction and decompaction traces is plotMinaConds.m

The analysis code for compaction traces is anCondense.m
The analysis code for decompaction traces is in anConVel.m
