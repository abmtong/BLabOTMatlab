Opening traces
-H1: opening is 50nm at a time?
+H1:  large step sizes ... ?

-Condensin:
Length of time at low F correlate to time to unfold is lost?
 (WT: wait longer, unfold for longer; C: not true ish)


In general, can i do something about the opening sections?

Compare results of minis to HiRes? LUMICKS???



New Notes

Have very noisy, potentially baseline-shifting steps(?)
Stepfinding seems good at picking out levels, but step size doesn't show a trend,
 while e.g. different conditions show different behaviors (eg cond. amt.)
