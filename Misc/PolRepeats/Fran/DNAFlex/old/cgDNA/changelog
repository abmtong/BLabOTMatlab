 - added wcc.m for Watson-Crick complementary sequence.
 - cosmetic changes to main.m;
 - made shapes.txt more informative (tested data is identical);
 - substitute reference shapes.txt with new format (test_reference);;
 - added wcc function to compute WC complementary sequence;
 - used wcc in printShapeParms and makePDB;
 - un-hardcoded filename in makePDB (base_atoms.pdb);

 - added output of old frames.m to test_reference.


v0.1b:
 - Added test case;
 - debugged and tested previous commit.
 - added a =test.m= script that executes main and converts mat files to plain text (16 digits);
 - added a =test_reference= folder containing test results after initial commit;
 - test using (should only find differences in .mat files.):
      diff -wbr test_reference test



v0.1:
 - solved issue 2b; partially solved issue 1.
 - removed duplicate definitions of vector2shapes and shapes2vector
 - removed file saving from functions =constructed_seq_parms.mat= and
   =absolute_coord.mat= are now generated in main.m (only for testing).
 - TODO: explain the =basepair= structure returned by frames.m
