% cgDNA, version 1.0.1 (2014)
%-------------------------------------------------------    

cgDNA is a software (Matlab or Octave) package for
predicting the ground-state conformation and stiffness
matrix of a molecule of B-form DNA of any given sequence.
Free energy differences between two configurations of a
molecule of B-form DNA in standard environmental
conditions, can then be computed.

The ground-state conformation is provided in the Curves+
definition of the DNA structural coordinates (both a
non-dimensional version and the original unscaled version),
and also as a PDB file of atomic coordinates. The PDB file
can be used in the program 3DNA to obtain 3DNA structural
coordinates if desired. The ground-state stiffness matrix
is provided for non-dimensional version of the Curves+
helical coordinates.

% cgDNA usage notes
%-------------------------------------------------------

Please see the section on testing cgDNA, below. To use
cgDNA:

1) Add the location of the cgDNA library to your path
(see "help addpath"). Alternatively, copy all the package 
files into your working directory.

2) Locate your working directory in your Matlab (or
Octave) session.

3) Enter "main" at the Matlab (or Octave) prompt to obtain
the predicted ground-state conformation and stiffness matrix
of a molecule of B-form DNA, given its base sequence. The
script produces ground-state coarse-grain coordinates in
"shapes.txt", and ideal atomic coordinates of bases in
"base_atoms.pdb". The DNA sequence can be changed by editing
the file "main.m".

4) Enter "main_energy" at the prompt to run through an
example workflow to estimate coarse-grain free energy
difference between two configurations of a molecule of
B-form DNA.  The nature of the configurations compared can
be modified by editing the file "main_energy.m". Note that
"main_energy" requires access to the "examples/" folder.

A full description of the main programs and each function is
provided at the top of each file.

The package was tested on Matlab??? versions 7.7
(R2008b), 7.14 (R2012a), 8.0 (R2012b) and GNU Octave
version 3.6.4 (http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

% cgDNA testing
%-------------------------------------------------------

To test that cgDNA works correctly:

1) Locate the "test" subfolder in the cgDNA directory
in your Matlab (or Octave) session.

2) Add the location of the cgDNA library to your path:
e.g., enter "addpath .." at the Matlab (or Octave) prompt.

3) Enter "cgDNAtests" at the prompt to perform tests: all
the tests are required to be passed to ensure reliable
results.

4) Check compatibility with your Curves+ installation:
follow instructions on screen to complete testing. 
In particular, run Curves+ on 1bna_bases.pdb to obtain
1bna_bases.lis:

/Users/RL/Code/Cur+ <<!
&inp file=1bna_bases.pdb,
 lis=1bna_bases, 
 lib=/Users/RL/Code/standard, &end
2 1 -1 0 0
1:12
24:13
!

assuming your Curves+ installation is in "/Users/RL/Code"
(see also http://gbio-pbil.ibcp.fr/Curves_plus).

5) Re-run "cgDNAtests": all tests must be passed.

Note that "cgDNAtest" relies on the "test_reference"
subfolder, where reference test results are stored.
