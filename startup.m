%Add paths relative to this folder, so it works regardless of where the code is located
%Use long names so we can create/delete them without worry of overwriting workspace var.s

%I like these formatting options, so also apply them here
format shortG %Allows for display of numbers with varying exponents, e.g. [1 1e99]
format compact %Removes extra line breaks when the command window shows an output
